# Mesh Simplification by Vertex Clustering Algorithm
The process of vertex clustering typically involves several steps:

1) Constructing a graph: The first step is to construct a graph where the vertices are nodes and the edges connect nearby vertices. The distance metric used to determine whether two vertices are "nearby" depends on the specific clustering algorithm being used.
2) Finding clusters: The next step is to identify clusters of vertices in the graph. This is typically done by running a clustering algorithm on the graph, such as k-means or hierarchical clustering.
3) Determining representative vertices: Once clusters have been identified, the next step is to determine a representative vertex for each cluster. This is typically done by computing the centroid of the cluster or by selecting the vertex that is closest to the center of the cluster.
4) Replacing clusters: The final step is to replace each cluster with its representative vertex. This involves updating the connectivity information of the mesh, such as the indices of the triangles that reference the vertices.
